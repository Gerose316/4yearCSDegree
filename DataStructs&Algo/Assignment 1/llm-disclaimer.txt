#Problem d I used LLM model to understand 

for(int i = 0; i < rrr.size(); i++){
       int v1 = rrr[i] - '0'; 
       total = total  + v1 * v2[i];
    } 

since this portion of converting the string into integer was causing various issues 
with just using std::stoi(str); since it was greatly altering my numbers with no apparent reason
So used ai to find different methods to substitute std::stoi(str); which I combined two different 
portions  I combined this
	orginal 
for(int i = 0; i < rrr.size(); i++){ 					ai generated 
       total = total  + v1 * v2[i];              and             int v1 = rrr[i] - '0';
    } 

to make the portion of the LLM model



#I also used problem g on small portions  which I used

 double rad = angle * M_PI / 180.0;

by chat gpt since every time I try to do the processes of calculating the equation it gave me different number every time which I ended up switching it up and allowing ai to debug my code for additional step to calculate the problem 




#lastly problem-f 

I was trying to sort the the list to ascending order and which I found a alternative in which allowed me to sort the list the way it needed to be when doing the ascending order I used the bro code method in which i used his ascending method which gave various problems with formatting and which ended up for me to use this 

std::sort(list2.begin(), list2.end()); 

to solve the problem.
